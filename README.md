# Speech-recognition-using-Java

- The agenda of code is to covert Speech to text. It is written on NetBeans platform.
- The application only identifies the words written in 'hello.gram' file, so please add more words in order to have smooth flow of
speech recognition.
- One small note is the speech is expected to sound like an American accent inorder to speedy and correct recognition. Improvements are yet 
to be made to match to all pitch.

Feel free to download and use it for your application. Happy coding :-)
